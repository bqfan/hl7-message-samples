Explanation of example 1
--------------------------
This would be a LIS system that treats each of the orders FBC & Urine MC&S as one 
report although on the same pathology request. You will see the first message
only contains the FBE and the second message contains both the FBE and the Urine. 
The FBE did not change it is just reissued when the Urine is finalised.
Also note that the display segments in the second message are the same under each
OBR, both contain the FBE and the Urine report all in one narrative.
This is the kind of system that would only build one CDA document for the request. 
   
Msg 1: The 'FBE: Full Blood Count' report finalised at 2015/04/10 at 11:15
Msg 2: The 'FBE: Full Blood Count' and the 'MCS urine: URINE MC&S' where the Urine was  finalised the next day at 2015/04/11 at 10:20
