Explanation of example 1
--------------------------
This would be a LIS system that treats each of the orders FBC & Urine MC&S as 
completely separate reports although on the same pathology request. It only 
outputs one report per message, you never get two reports in a single message.
This is the kind of system that would build many CDA documents for a request with 
many reports.
