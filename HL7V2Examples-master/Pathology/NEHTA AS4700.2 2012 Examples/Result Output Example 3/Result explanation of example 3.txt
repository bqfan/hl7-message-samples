Explanation of example 3
--------------------------
This would be a LIS system that treats each of the orders FBC & Urine MC&S as 
completely separate reports although on the same pathology request.
It outputs all reports in the same message. Notice the display segments under
each OBR only contain the report for that OBR. 
This is the kind of system that would build many CDA documents for a request with 
many reports. It would have to build many CDA documents per message one for each 
OBR segment.
