Portal venous phase ~images performed today. ~~Lung bases clear. The stomach and oesophagus is distended with fluid putting ~the patient at risk of aspiration. The proximal mid small bowel is abnormally~dilated *************** fluid and gas filled. Right sided ileostomy is noted.~Anterior resection of the large bowel with a small fluid and gas collection ~at the rectal anastomosis. The amount of fluid and gas at this location is ~mildly improved. The amount of fluid and gas in the collection is more than ~expected for a patient operated on the 25/11/14. The presence of an ~anastomotic leak is therefore raised. ~The calibre of the proximal mid small bowel is not as prominent as previous ~and there is swelling of the mesenteric vessels within the right flank as a ~persisting feature. ~The urinary bladder is distended. ~~COMMENT: Persisting fluid and gas collection at the presacral space adjacent ~to the rectal anastomosis is suspicous for an anastomotic leak. ~The calibre of the small bowel at its proximal mid location has decreased ~although the appearances are suggestive of an ongoing distal small bowel ~obstruction possibly via an internal hernia. ~~Dr T Wells Monday, 8 December 2014/KP~~External Link: ~https://ntpacs.nt.gov.au/synapsestudy.asp?path=/All%20Studies/\T\filter=RISOr~dersEUID=30207486~||||||FIN
